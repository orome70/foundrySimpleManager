# foundrySimpleManager

This module offers a drastic simplification of Foundry User interface. The main goal is to provide the first steps towards a dedicated Mobile app.

This is meant in order to use Foundry vtt as a "campaign manager", whether or not people are playing remotely. 

# Current status

At the moment the interface is almost untouched. Only the following elements are affected:

 * There is no game Canvas;
 * Only the following tabs are displayed in sidebar:
    * chat,
    * actors,
    * items,
    * journals,
    * settings
